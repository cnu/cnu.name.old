I am **cnu** (aka) **Srinivasan Rangarajan** in the real world. I am a software developer turned entrepreneur from India. I am currently working on my  search engine related startup [cruns](http://cruns.com). Previously I was working in a text analytics startup called [Serendio](http://www.serendio.com). 

I primarily work using [python](http://python.org/), though I have tried to learn some [new](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) [languages](http://www.lisp.org/) in the past. I also like to write (a lot) and had started a Social Blog network called [Blogial](http://blogial.com).

This site is created using [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) which is a nice little tool to build static websites. No databases, no dynamic parts in the page - just simple HTML files generated out of documents written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
