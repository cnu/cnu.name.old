For a long time all my personal stuff were posted on my [livejournal](http://cnu.livejournal.com), [blogger](http://cnus8n.blogspot.com) or [posterous](http://cnu.posterous.com) blogs. I always wanted to get my own domain name, but couldn't get [cnu.in](http://cnu.in) or [cnu.me](http://cnu.me) as they were already registered.

<!-- more -->

And one day while doing a domain search, I found that [cnu.name](http://cnu.name) was available and is a better choice than the [.in ccTLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.in) or [.me ccTLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.me) as [.name gTLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.name)s are for names and nicknames. 

So I bought it and then was trying out various static blog generators like the famous [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) & [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) as well as other lesser known scripts. I then decided on using [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) though written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) was easy to start off with and extend.

This site and blog will be only for my personal posts and as a list of things I have done. Other generic topics will be posted to [Blogial](http://blogial.com), which will receive a total redesign and relaunch. As for my older posts, they will remain in the other sites till they shut down the service, when I may think about archiving it. 

I am still theming the site which is inspired from [thpani.at](http://thpani.at) (but converted into HTML5 and with bigger fonts) and a few parts of the nanoc code for the blog from [clarkdave.net](http://clarkdave.net/2012/02/building-a-static-blog-with-nanoc/). Am posting this post and hopefully a few more early than the launch so that I don't end up with a empty site.
